\section{Introduction}
\label{section:introduction}
%---------------------------

For more than a decade, halo occupation modeling has been used to
interpret large-scale structure measurements and exploit these
measurements to constrain galaxy formation models and cosmology
\citep[e.g.,][]{yang03,tinker05,zehavi05a,porciani06,vdBosch07,
  Zheng07,conroy_wechsler09,yang09b,zehavi_etal11,guo_etal11b,
  wake_etal11,yang11a,yang12,leauthaud_etal12,rodriguezpuebla_etal12,
  tinker_etal13,cacciato_etal13,more_etal13,guo_etal14,zu_mandelbaum15b}. The
key assumptions underlying halo occupation modeling are: (1) all
galaxies reside in dark matter halos that are biased tracers of the
density field; and (2) galaxies occupy halos as a function of halo
masses only. It is now well known that halo bias depends upon halo
properties other than mass
\citep[e.g.][]{gao_etal05,wechsler06,gao_white07,zentner07,dalal_etal08,lacerna11},
an effect called halo assembly bias. If galaxies occupy halos as a
function of properties other than halo mass, then standard halo
occupation methods will be subject to a systematic error due to galaxy
assembly bias. Several of us have previously shown that this error can
be significant in an analysis of galaxy clustering and can bias
inferences about many aspects of galaxy evolution
\citep{zentner_etal14}. Consequently, we have developed halo
occupation models that enable galaxies to occupy halos in a manner
that depends upon several halo properties \citep{hearin_etal16}. In
this paper, we revisit the interpretation of luminosity-dependent
galaxy clustering in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release
7 (DR7) data, analyzed previously by \citet{zehavi_etal11}, in the
context both standard halo occupation models and these new models.

The ultimate goal of halo occupation modeling is to characterize the
galaxy-dark matter connection by constraining the probability
distribution $P(X_{\rm g}|Y_{\rm h})$. Here $X_{\rm g} = {x_1, x_2,
  ...x_n}$ is a set of $n$ galaxy properties, and $Y_{\rm h} = {y_1,
  y_2,...,y_m}$ a set of $m$ halo properties. Accurate knowledge of
this probability distribution yields invaluable insight to the
processes of galaxy formation, and allows one to make accurate
predictions for the clustering of galaxies as function of any property
$x_i$. Most halo occupation studies to date have focussed on
luminosity or stellar mass as the only galaxy property, and halo
virial mass as the only halo property.  This includes all Halo
Occupation Distribution (HOD) models (e.g. Kauffmann, Nusser \&
Steinmetz 1997; Jing, Mo \& B\"orner 1998; Berlind \& Weinberg 2002)
which aim to constrain $P(N|\mvir)$, the probability that a halo of
mass $M$ contains $N$ galaxies of some specified properties (typically
a luminosity or stellar mass larger than some threshold value), and
all Conditional Luminosity Function (CLF) models, which aim to
constrain $\Phi(L|M)$, the luminosity (or stellar mass) function of
galaxies in haloes of mass $M$. The HOD and CLF models are mainly used
in combination with the halo model, which describes the non-linear
matter field in terms of halo building blocks (e.g., ), to predict the
clustering of galaxies as function of luminosity or stellar mass.
Although entirely analytical, and therefore fast, the downside of this
method is that it is extremely challenging to construct a model that
is accurate at the few percent level. The main issues are halo
exclusion (Cooray \& Seth; van den Bosch \etal 2013), scale dependence
of the halo bias (e.g., Tinker et al. ), and the halo assembly bias
mentioned above.

These issues are trivially avoided by directly populating dark matter
haloes in numerical simulations with galaxies. This can be done using
either a parameterized model for the halo occupation statistics (e.g.,
Yang \etal 2004; Moster \etal 2010; Behroozi \etal 2010, 2013; Rodriguez-Puebla, Drory
\& Avila-Reese 2012;)


Hydrodynamical simulations and semi-analytical models for galaxy formation
can also be used to populated haloes with galaxies, but these methods are
typically much too slow to be used for still much to slow to 


Another approach to halo occupation
modeling is subhalo abundance matching (SHAM), which assigns galaxies
to dark matter haloes in numerical simulations by rank-order matching
galaxy properties (i.e., luminosity or stellar mass) to halo
properties (i.e., halo mass). Although many SHAM studies use
halo mass as the halo property of choice (Vale \& Ostriker 2004,2006;
Conroy, Wechsler \& Kravtsov 2007; Conroy \& Wechsler 2009)

Tasitsiomi \etal 2004; V_{max}
Conroy, Wechsler \& Kravtsov (2006) uses V_max
Conroy, Wechsler \& Kravtsov (2007) uses Mvir
Conroy \& Wechsler (2009) uses Mvir
Marin \etal 2008 uses V_max


All halo occupation distribution models, which model the
probabilitys mentioned above, most halo occupation studies to date have
focussed on luminosity or stellar mass as the only galaxy property,
and halo virial mass as the only halo property. 

been limited to
$Y_{\rm h} = M_{\rm vir$ (i.e., halo virial mass is the one and only
  halo property determining the occupation statistics), and have
  foc

In recent years, there have been a few studies See also
\citet{lehman_etal15} for a similar approach.


Also, we may want to point out that
SHAM has already started to consider other properties than halo mass
(Vmax, Vpeak etc) (e.g., Conroy, Wechsler \& Kravtsov 2006; Reddick et
al. 2013; Hearin et al. 2013). Since, at fixed halo mass, Vmax is
correlated with halo concentration, and thus with halo assembly time,
the resulting occupation models have assembly bias build in; i.e., at
fixed halo mass, galaxy properties will be correlated with halo
assembly time. This was taken one step further by Hearin ccc, who developed
an extension of SHAM, called age-matching. 

Lehmann et al. (2015) explored SHAM models in which the subhalo
property $x$ varies between Mvir and Vmax via a continuously-valued
parameter $\alpha$. They fit the newly introduced parameter, $\alpha$,
to SDSS clustering measurements at $z \simeq 0$, and their best-fit
model significantly prefers “Vmax−like” subhalo properties over
“pure-Mvir” properties. That is, low-redshift clustering measurements
are better described by SHAM-style models in which $\langle N_\rms
\rangle$ and $\langle N_\rmc \rangle$ do not depend on virial mass
Mvir alone (see also Mao, Williamson & Wechsler 2015, for closely
related work).


Our work is important for several reasons. Our work is a re-analysis
of the SDSS DR7 data the overcomes shortcomings of previous
analyses. In particular, we use direct population of galaxies in a
cosmological simulation so that delicate issues present in analytic
modeling, such as scale-dependent halo bias, are treated exactly.  The
simulation we use is based on the latest Planck cosmological
parameters, updating previous work. Furthermore, many important
differences between this work and the previous work of
\citet{zehavi_etal11} were caused by insufficiently large Monte Carlo
Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling by \citet[][Z. Zheng \& I. Zehavi,
  Private Communication]{zehavi_etal11}. Therefore, our analysis {\em
  supersedes previous analyses even in the case of standard halo
  occupation models}.

Furthermore, our work demonstrates explicitly that significant
assembly bias in $M_r$-selected samples from SDSS DR7 cannot be ruled
out based on a standard analysis of galaxy clustering only. In fact,
we find that several samples {\em favor galaxy assembly bias to a
  degree that is statistically significant}. As demonstrated by
\citet{zentner_etal14}, this conclusion could have important
consequences for the interpretation of both extant and forthcoming
data.

Our paper is organized as follows. In Section~\ref{section:methods},
we discuss our implementation of halo occupation models and our
assumptions in our parameter inference analysis. We present results
for both standard halo occupation analysis and analysis in the context
of models with galaxy assembly bias in
Section~\ref{section:results}. We summarize our results and draw
conclusions in Section~\ref{section:conclusions}.

\section{Methods}
\label{section:methods}
%---------------------------

%---------------------------
\subsection{Halotools Implementation of HOD Models}
\label{subsection:halotools}
%---------------------------

To generate predictions for galaxy clustering, we directly populate dark matter halos with mock galaxies using {\tt Halotools}. In this section we review the ``standard" HOD-style model used in the present work, and in the following section we use the Decorated HOD model described in \citet{hearin_etal16}. In both cases, we will only briefly review the salient features of our methodology here; interested readers can always refer to {\tt halotools.readthedocs.io} for further details. 

\subsubsection{Simulation}
All of our analyses are based on the Bolshioi-Planck simulation \citep{riebe_etal11}. 
Bolshoi-Planck was run with cosmological parameters based on \citet{planck13}, $\Omega_{\Lambda} = 0.693, \Omega_{\rm m} = 0.307, \Omega_{\rm b} = 0.048, h = 0.7, {\rm n_s}=0.96$ and $\sigma_8 = 0.82,$ and with a box size of $250$ ${\rm Mpc}/h$ and a particle mass of $m_{\rm p} = 1.35\times10^{8}M_{\odot}/h.$ Further information about the Bolshoi-Planck simulation is available at \url{https://www.cosmosim.org}. 

We use publicly available\footnote{\tt http://www.slac.stanford.edu/$\sim$behroozi/BPlanck\_Hlists} dark matter halo catalogs based on the {\tt ROCKSTAR} halo-finder \citep{behroozi_rockstar11} and {\tt CONSISTENT TREES} algorithm \citep{behroozi_trees13}. In particular, we use the {\tt halotools\_alpha\_version2} version of the $z=0$ snapshot of the {\tt `bolplanck'} catalog included with {\tt Halotools.} Halos in these catalogs are based on the virial radius density contrast given in \citet{bryan_norman98}. When populating this catalog with mock galaxies, we only use present-day host halos with a value of $M_{\rm peak}$ that exceeds $300$ particles. 


\subsubsection{Occupation statistics}

In standard HOD models, there are two types of galaxies: centrals and satellites. The galaxy-halo connection is specified in terms of $P(\ncen|\mvir)$ and $P(\nsat|\mvir),$ the probability that a halo of mass $\mvir$ hosts $\ncen$ central and $\nsat$ satellite galaxies, respectively. $P(\ncen|\mvir)$ is typically a nearest-integer distribution, as a host halo has only either zero or one central galaxy. So occupation statistics of central galaxies are specified by the first moment of $P(\ncen|\mvir)$, which we model as 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ncen}
\langle N_{\mathrm{cen}} \rangle(\mvir) =
        \frac{1}{2}\left( 1 +
        \mathrm{erf}\left( \frac{\log_{10}\mvir -
        \log_{10}M_{\rm min}}{\sigma_{\log_{10}M}} \right) \right)
\end{equation}
For every host halo in the catalog we draw a random number from a uniform distribution $\mathcal{U}(0, 1);$ for a host halo of present-day virial mass $\mvir,$ a central galaxy is assigned to the halo if the associated random number is less than $\langle N_{\mathrm{cen}} \rangle(\mvir);$ halos with random values exceeding  $\langle N_{\mathrm{cen}} \rangle(\mvir)$ are left devoid of centrals. 

We model the distribution $P(\nsat|\mvir)$ to be a Poisson distribution with first moment given by a power law, 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:nsat}
\langle N_{\rm sat}\rangle(\mvir) = \left( \frac{\mvir - M_0}{M_1} \right)^{\alpha}. 
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Galaxy profiles}

Central galaxies in the standard HOD models reside at the halo center, moving with the same velocity as the host halo peculiar velocity. We model the intra-halo spatial distribution of satellite galaxies to be located within $\rvir$ of the halo center, with a spherically symmetric NFW profile \citep{nfw97}. The concentration $c$ of each halo's satellite galaxy profile is taken to be the same as the concentration of the dark matter particles in the halo.\footnote{We set a maximum value of $c=25$ to the NFW concentration, because halos with very large values for the concentration tend to be poorly described by an NFW profile, for example due to a recent merger.}

We model the velocities of satellite galaxies to be a Gaussian whose first moment is the host halo velocity and whose second moment is the solution to the isotropic Jeans equation for an NFW profile \citep{more09b}, 
\begin{equation}
\sigma^{2}_{r}(\tilde{r}|c) = V_{\rm vir}^{2}\frac{c^{2}\tilde{r}(1 + c\tilde{r})^{2}}{g(c)}\int_{c\tilde{r}}^{\infty}{\rm d}y\frac{g(y)}{y^{3}(1 + y)^{2}}, 
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{r} = r/\rvir,$ $g(x) = \rm{ln}(1+x) - x / (1+x),$ and $V_{\rm vir}^{2} = G\mvir/\rvir.$


%---------------------------
\subsection{HOD with Assembly Bias: The Decorated HOD}
\label{subsection:decorated}
%---------------------------

In addition to the standard occupation statistics described in the
previous section, in this paper we also use the decorated HOD
formalism to connect galaxies to dark matter halos in a manner that
has simultaneous dependence on both $\mvir$ and halo
concentration. Briefly, we use Equations \ref{eq:ncen} and
\ref{eq:nsat} as our ``baseline" first occupation moments. At fixed
$\mvir,$ halos are divided into one of two categories, those of high-
and low-concentration, depending on whether the concentration of the
halo places it above or below the rank-order percentile $f_{\rm
  split},$ which we keep fixed to $f_{\rm split}=0.5$ throughout the
paper. High-concentration halos have a different first occupation
moment relative to low-concentration halos of the same mass,
$\langle\ngal|\mvir, c_{\rm high}\rangle \neq \langle\ngal|\mvir,
c_{\rm low}\rangle.$ The difference between the first moment of high-
and low-concentration halos is modulated by $\abias,$ the novel
parameter of the decorated HOD governing assembly bias. Values of
$\abias=\pm1$ correspond to the maximum strength of assembly bias
allowable by the constraint that the model preserves the marginalized
first moment, $\langle\ngal|\mvir\rangle;$ thus regardless of the
value of $\abias,$ in the decorated HOD the marginalized first moment
of centrals and satellites are unchanged from the baseline value
defined by Equations \ref{eq:ncen} and \ref{eq:nsat}. We refer the
reader to \citet{hearin_etal16} for further details about the
decorated HOD.

%---------------------------
\subsection{Parameter Inference}
\label{subsection:mcmc}
%---------------------------

To infer parameters for the HOD and Decorated HOD models described in the previous subsections, 
we performed a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling of the posteriors using the 
affine-invariant ensemble sampler of \citet{goodman_weare10} as implemented in the 
{\tt emcee} software package \citep{foreman-mackey_etal13}. For most cases, we find that 
$\sim 3-10 \times 10^{6}$ samples are necessary in order for our chains to converge.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The most important detail of this analysis is the priors on the parameters. In all analyses 
discussed in this paper, we adopt priors that are uniform distributions over the intervals 
specified in Table~\ref{table:priors}. In the case of the assembly bias parameters 
$A_{\mathrm{cen}}$ and $A_{\mathrm{sat}}$, the priors represent physical 
boundaries. These parameters must satisfy $-1 \le A_{\mathrm{cen,sat}} \le 1$. 
Physical considerations require parameter $\sigma_{\log M} > 0$. All other 
priors have a negligible influence on the posterior aside from $\log M_0$. 
We find that $\log M_0$ is often very poorly constrained by clustering data.


%---------------------------
\section{Results}
\label{section:results}
%---------------------------

We have performed parameter inference analyses in order to infer the underlying HOD of 
galaxies from the projected galaxy two-point function $\wprp(\rp)$ as described in the preceding 
section. In this section, we describe the primary results of these analyses. Our marginalized 
one-dimensional parameter constraints are given in Table~\ref{table:parameters}.

%-------------------------
\subsection{Standard Analysis}
\label{subsection:standard}
%-------------------------

Prior to discussing our results using models that include assembly bias, we present 
results of standard HOD analyses that include no model for assembly bias. The results of 
the standard HOD analyses and all other analyses are shown in the form of marginalized 
constraints on individual parameters in Table~\ref{table:parameters}. We compare our parameter 
constraints to the standard HOD analysis performed by \citet{zehavi_etal11} in Table~\ref{table:parameters} 
as well. An example of the inferred posteriors for the HOD parameters is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Mr20triangle}. 
The left-hand panels of Figure~\ref{fig:Mr19samples}, Figure~\ref{fig:Mr20samples}, and Figure~\ref{fig:Mr21samples} 
show the projected correlation function data along with predictions for $\wprp(\rp)$ from 50 randomly-selected 
models from the MCMC chains. Note that the significant covariance in the data makes it difficult to 
determine the quality of fit from visual inspection of these figures.

\end{figure*}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The inferred parameters from our standard analyses differ in several ways from the \citet{zehavi_etal11} 
analysis. Firstly, in our re-analysis of the projected clustering data, we generally find all mass scales to 
be slightly higher than in the work of \citet{zehavi_etal11}. This difference is largely due to the slightly 
different cosmologies adopted in this work. The most important difference 
are in the values of $\Omega_{\rm M}$, and $\sigma_8$.  
\citet{zehavi_etal11} assumed $\Omega_{\rm M}=0.25$ and $\sigma_8=0.8$, 
whereas in the present work, we use the BolshoiP simulation in which $\Omega_{\rm M}=0.307$ and $\sigma_8=0.82$. 
Slightly larger mass scales are necessary in an analysis with higher $\Omega_{\rm M}$ and $\sigma_8$ in order 
to maintain galaxy number densities with larger halo number densities.

Results of standard HOD fits to SDSS DR7 $w_{\rm p}(r_{\rm p})$ as well as 
fits using a parameterized model of assembly bias. 
Assembly bias is quantified by the parameters $A_{\rm cen}$ ($A_{\rm sat}$) for central (satellite) galaxies. The secondary 
property that we assume to determine the galaxy HOD is halo formation time. $A_{\rm cen,sat}=0$ means that there is no 
assembly bias while $A_{\rm cen,sat}=1$ ($A_{\rm cen,sat}=-1$) means that halo formation time is maximally 
correlated (anticorrelated) with halo formation time. Thus the parameters range over $-1 \le A_{\rm cen,sat} \le 1$. 
If the constraints on $A_{\rm cen}$ and $A_{\rm sat}$ are unspecified, then the model used to interpret the data 
does not include assembly bias. In our analyses, quoted parameter values with errors correspond to the median 
value of the parameter and the 16$^{\rm th}$ and 84$^{\rm th}$ percentiles. In cases for which the posterior 
is monotonic within the physical parameter space, we show one-sided percentiles.

A second noteworthy difference between the present work and that of
\citet{zehavi_etal11} is that we find many parameters to be notably
more poorly constrained. At the lower luminosity thresholds, for
example, we constrain $\log (M_{\rm min})$ and $\sigma_{\log M}$ with
several times lower precision than \citet{zehavi_etal11}. We do not
show our constraints on $\log (M_0)$ as they are very poor, with
1-sigma constraints $\gta 1$~dex for all samples. In several cases,
the constraint on $\log (M_0)$ is determined by the prior given in
Table~\ref{table:priors}. This is in stark contrast to several of the
results of \citet{zehavi_etal11}. For example, for the threshold
sample with $M_r < -19.5$ ($M_r < -20.5$), \citet{zehavi_etal11} quote
$\log (M_0) = 12.23 \pm 0.17$ ($12.35 \pm 0.24$), whereas we infer
$\log (M_0) = 11.38^{+0.95}_{-1.57}$
($11.19^{+0.89}_{-1.39}$). Examining the form of Eq.~(\ref{eq:nsat}),
it is sensible that the parameter $\log (M_0)$ should be unconstrained
at the lower end, because the value of $M_0$ does not alter the
predicted satellite number once $M_0 \ll M_1$. Therefore, it seems
likely that the tighter constraints quoted by \citet{zehavi_etal11}
must be an error.

We have confirmed with a subset of the authors of \citet{zehavi_etal11} 
that the number of MCMC samples they included in their analysis was 
insufficient in a number of cases and that this can lead to a significant underestimation of the uncertainties 
on the inferred parameters, especially $\log (M_{\rm min})$ and $\sigma_{\log M}$ 
(Z. Zheng \& I. Zehavi, Private Communication). The analysis of \citet{zehavi_etal11} 
used $10^4$ samples, whereas we find several $\times 10^6$ samples are often necessary for convergence. 
Additionally, we have recreated qualitatively similar behavior by considering only small subsets of our 
full MCMC chains. Consequently, insufficient sampling of the posterior seems to be the likely resolution 
of the discrepancies between our work and that of \citet{zehavi_etal11}.

Two degeneracies are manifest in Fig.~\ref{fig:Mr20triangle} that are common to all of our 
analyses. The parameters $\log (M_1)$ and $\alpha$ are degenerate with each other and positively 
correlated. The parameter $M_1$ is the mass scale at which a halo has one satellite on 
average and $\alpha$ is the power-law index describing the dependence of average satellite 
number on halo mass. Increasing $M_1$ decreases the number of satellites in large halos 
by placing satellites preferentially in halos of larger mass. An increase in $\alpha$ can partly 
compensate for an increase in $M_1$ by increasing the rate at which average satellite number 
grows with halo mass, leading to a larger number of satellites in high-mass halos. 

As is evident in Figure~\ref{fig:Mr20triangle}, $\log (M_{\rm min})$ and $\sigma_{\log M}$ 
share a relatively narrow degeneracy as well. This degeneracy is largely induced by the 
measured number density of the sample. Increasing $\log (M_{\rm min})$ decreases galaxy 
number density, but this can be compensated by an increase in $\sigma_{\log M}$, which 
places galaxies in a fraction of the considerably more numerous halos with masses less 
than $M_{\rm min}$. The consequence is that $\log (M_{\rm min})$ and $\sigma_{\log M}$ are 
degenerate with each other such that most of the posterior probability lies in a narrow band 
along which $\log (M_{\rm min})$ and $\sigma_{\log M}$ are positively correlated, as shown in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:Mr20triangle}. In the following plots, we suppress the parameter $\sigma_{\log M}$,  
in order to increase the clarity of the plots, because the viable range of $\sigma_{\log M}$ is 
determined by this simple degeneracy with $\log (M_{\rm min})$. 

The results of this subsection demonstrate that we achieve reasonable fits to projected galaxy clustering 
data using direct HOD population of a high-resolution numerical simulation of structure formation. These results 
also update and supersede existing constraints in the literature in at least three respects. First, we work within the 
best-fit Planck cosmology. Second, we perform our parameter inference analysis using direct population of halos 
identified in a numerical simulation of cosmological structure formation (BolshioP). This greatly mitigates modeling 
uncertainties associated with nonlinear density field evolution, scale-dependent halo bias, halo exclusion, 
or other effects that have been difficult to incorporate into analytical halo models with high precision. Third, 
we have explored the posteriors of the parameters with significantly more samples (roughly two orders of magnitude), 
thereby mitigating errors on inferred parameters and their errors induced by insufficient sampling of the 
posterior.

\subsection{Analysis with Decorated HOD}
\label{subsection:ab}
%-------------------------

We turn now to a discussion of our parameter inference analysis of projected galaxy clustering 
in Decorated HOD models that include a treatment of galaxy assembly bias. In this work, 
we consider only the simplest model of galaxy assembly bias, introducing only two new 
parameters, $A_{\rm cen}$ and $A_{\rm sat}$, that describe the strength of central galaxy 
and satellite galaxy assembly bias respectively. These parameters are limited to values 
of $-1 \le A_{\rm cen,sat} \le 1$, and $A_{\rm cen,sat}=0$ when there is no galaxy assembly bias. 
In this work, we use halo concentration as our secondary halo property, so $A_{\rm cen,sat}=1$ 
($A_{\rm cen,sat}=-1$) means that the mean number of galaxies per halo is maximally 
correlated (anti-correlated) with halo concentration. The model and its implementation 
in {\tt halotools} is discussed further in Section~\ref{subsection:decorated} above and 
in \citet{hearin_etal16}.

Examples of our fits are given in the right-hand panels of Figure~\ref{fig:Mr19samples}, 
Figure~\ref{fig:Mr20samples}, and Figure~\ref{fig:Mr21samples}. The general trend that 
can be gleaned from these figures is that introducing assembly bias improves the ability 
of the predicted two-point functions to match the measured two-point functions across the 
transition form the one-halo (highly nonlinear) to two-halo (nearly linear) regimes near $\rp \sim 2\, h^{-1}{\mathrm{Mpc}}$. 
This is most apparent for the $M_r < -20$ threshold sample shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Mr20samples}. 
Visually, these differences appear to be small; however, Table~\ref{table:parameters} shows that 
they are statistically important.

The one-dimensional marginalized constraints on all parameters from these analyses 
are given in the lowest row of each luminosity threshold grouping in Table~\ref{table:parameters}. 
In cases where the posterior on a parameter is monotonic within the physical parameter 
range, we quote an upper or lower limit on the parameter. One- and two-dimensional 
visualizations of the posteriors from our analysis are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Mr19ABtriangle}, 
Figure~\ref{fig:Mr20ABtriangle}, and Figure~\ref{fig:Mr21ABtriangle}.

  in Fig.~\ref{fig:Mr20triangle}. The decorated HOD models include a
  two-parameter model for assembly bias. The HOD parameter $\log
  (M_0)$ is extremely poorly constrained by the data and has been
  suppressed for clarity. Likewise, as in Fig.~\ref{fig:Mr20triangle},
  $\sigma_{\log M}$ and $\log (M_{\rm min})$ share a narrow
  degeneracy, so we have suppressed $\sigma_{\log M}$ in order to make
  constraints on other parameters more easily visible.  }

Table~\ref{table:parameters} and Figures~\ref{fig:Mr19ABtriangle}-\ref{fig:Mr21triangle} 
all make several simple, generic points. Introducing additional parameter 
freedom associated with galaxy assembly bias generally increases the viable parameter 
space, even for the subset of standard HOD parameters. Constraints on the 
standard HOD parameters are generally less restrictive. This is exactly what is 
expected from the introduction of additional parameter freedom. 


Focusing attention on the parameters describing galaxy assembly bias, it is 
evident that these parameters are often quite poorly constrained by galaxy 
clustering data. This is important as it implies that galaxy clustering of the precision 
of SDSS DR7 measurements cannot rule out, or strongly restrict galaxy assembly 
bias in many cases. Nonetheless, it is apparent that the presence of assembly bias 
can alter the inferred HOD, or more generally, the inferred relationship between 
galaxies and halo mass. This is most evident for the $M_r < -20$ threshold sample, 
for which there are significant differences in the inferred values of all baseline HOD 
parameters between models with and without galaxy assembly bias. Other threshold 
samples exhibit significant changes particularly for $\alpha$, and to a lesser degree 
for $\log (M_{\rm min})$ and $\sigma_{\log M}$. 


Beyond those generic conclusions, a few specific cases are worthy of further examination. 
Consider the $M_r < -20$ sample. The inferred value of $A_{\rm cen} > 0.28$ at 99\% 
confidence. In this case the data strongly prefer $A_{\rm cen} > 0$ and thus strongly prefer 
galaxies to reside in halos of larger concentration at fixed halo mass. This particular threshold 
sample is the most significant outlier in this regard. Nevertheless, there are hints of assembly 
bias in other samples. Satellite galaxies show a marginal preference for occupying halos of 
higher concentration in the $M_r < -19$ threshold sample. The $M_r < -19$ sample exhibits 
weak preference for a positive correlation of galaxy occupation with halo concentration at fixed 
mass for both satellite galaxies and central galaxies. Continuing upward with luminosity, 
the $M_r < -20.5$ sample exhibits a significant preference for central galaxy assembly bias. 
Lastly, there is no preference for either central galaxy or satellite galaxy assembly bias 
for the $M_r < -21$ threshold sample, for which both $A_{\mathrm{cen}}$ and $A_{\mathrm{sat}}$ 
are consistent with zero will within 1$\sigma$. These data suggest that assembly bias 
may be present in the real universe.
